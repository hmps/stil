STIL CSS
========

Stil CSS is a mini style guide for CSS. It's mini in the sense that its only concern is naming conventions in CSS, there's nothing in here about whitespace, where you should put your brackets or how many selectors you should have per line.

Stil is inspired by the awesome work of [Jonathan Snooks on SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), [Nicole Sullivan on OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [Yandex on BEM](http://bem.info/), and [Harry Roberts on CSS in large scale apps](http://csswizardry.com/).
